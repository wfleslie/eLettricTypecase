First stages of prototyping the final case.

This version uses a single multiplexer attached to 8 paper boxes that mimic actual compartments from the type case. I used different sized compartments to test out the lights with the range of different sizes they'll be put to use in. The top of the prototype is relatively clean, and is close-ish to how the final will look, whereas the underside is a jungle of wires, which won't be part of the final.

I have decided to add covers to all of the compartments (not shown in the photo) to circumvent problems of where to place your finger in the different sized boxes. The covers might also alleviate the need for the individual optoisolators, but that remains to be tested.
