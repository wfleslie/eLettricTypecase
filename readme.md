eLettric Typecase

This repository is to track my progress creating eLettric Typecase -- a reconstructed letterpress typecase that will function as a computer keyboard.

Each folder contains a sub-trajectory of the project, exploring various facets ultimately leading to the final project. There are photos, code files, and wiring diagrams as appropriate.
