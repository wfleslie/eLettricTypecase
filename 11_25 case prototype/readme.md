Case Prototype

I used a laser cutter to quickly fashion a mock-up of the middle section of the type case using 1/4 inch and 1/8 inch masonite. Actually having a to-scale physical model will allow me to make decisions about materials, wiring routes, and edits to be made. For instance, I already know I want to shrink the finger hole sizes.
